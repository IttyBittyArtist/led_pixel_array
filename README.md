# led_pixel_array
Open LED 3D Pixel Array - an accessible way to create a 3D pixel array. We have taken a scalable, modular approach with the design. This means that the array's size limitations are based on the length of LED lights that the user selects, the power that they require, your budget, your controller's outputs, and the height of the space in which you install the array.

There are three main aspects of this project:
1. [Physical construction of the array](https://github.com/IttyBittyArtist/led_pixel_array/wiki/LED-Array-Construction) 
2. (Controllers and DMX](https://github.com/IttyBittyArtist/led_pixel_array/wiki/Controlling-LEDs-with-DMX)
3. Graphics creation and animation

All plans are openly available in this repository, however if you are short on time or labor - or if you don't have access to a laser cutter, we are happy to ship kits of any or all parts you may need to complete the build.
