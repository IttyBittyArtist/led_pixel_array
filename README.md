There are three main aspects of this project:
1. Physical construction of the array
2. Electronics programming
3. Graphics creation and animation

All plans are openly available in this repository, however if you are short on time or labor - or if you don't have access to a laser cutter, we are happy to ship kits of any or all parts you may need to complete the build. 

If you would like to support this project - if you've used the files or would like to see us make improvements, please drop us a line and leave us a tip!
